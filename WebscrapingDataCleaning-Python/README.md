# Web Scraping and Data Cleaning of Top 100 Thai Dramas on MDL

## Project Goal: 
The goal of this project is to extract and clean data about the top 100 Thai dramas on MyDramaList (MDL). This dataset will be used for further analysis and visualization.

## Project Deliverables: 
The deliverables of this project will be a clean dataset of the top 100 Thai dramas on MDL and a Jupyter Notebook that describes the process of scraping and cleaning the data.

## Project Timeline: 
##### This project will be completed in 2 weeks. The following is a tentative schedule:

- Week 1 | Day 1-4: Research web scraping with Python
- Week 1 | Day 5-7: Scrape the data from MDL
- Week 2 | Day 1-6: Clean the data using NumPy and Pandas
- Week 2 | Day 7: Export cleaned data into a CSV file

## Project Resources: 
##### The following resources will be used for this project:

* Python programming language
* Beautiful Soup library
* Requests library
* NumPy library
* Pandas library
* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Challenges: 
##### The following are some of the challenges that may be encountered during this project:

* Understanding how to use the Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries
* Troubleshooting errors that may occur during the scraping process
* Dealing with inconsistent or missing data
* Cleaning the data to ensure that it is accurate and consistent

## Project Success Criteria: 
##### The project will be considered a success if the following criteria are met:

- The data is extracted from MDL accurately and completely.
- The data is cleaned to ensure that it is accurate and consistent.
